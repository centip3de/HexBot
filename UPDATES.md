* Added in FLAGSHOW OPCode as 0xE to display whether the flags are currently ticked or not
* Added in all bit shift manipulations! (Right shift, left shift, AND, OR, XOR, NOT)
* All OPCodes past 0x5 have been changed! Please review the code for the changes!
* Expanded write interrupt to be able to write register contents to screen (cData only)
* Increased accuracy in decteding whether a token is referencing a register or not

CPU.c: 
* Added the skeleton for if statements (which will be next week)

* Added fclose()'s! 
* Register contents now can be writen to screen
* Changed executeInt() to properly check the correct registers (Was previously checking the wrong part of reg 2)

Registers.c:
* Changed getNData() to be of the integer type, instead of word type.
